# Advent of code 2024

My personal entries for the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2024 event.
All entries are written in F# script files.

## How to run

To run the scripts you'll need an F# interactive script runner.
The easiest to use is the `dotnet cli`, which has one installed by default.

```Powershell
dotnet fsi <PATH_TO_SCRIPT>
```
